## Weekly Training Rhythm
| Day       | Focus                                              |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Monday    | Easy run (Zone 2) + Core strength                  |
| Tuesday   | Steady aerobic (Zone 2–3)                          |

## General Principles
- **Long runs** are essential — no skipping
- **Speed sharpening** only after aerobic base
- Shin health = priority → reduce volume at first sign of pain
- Practice fueling with gels every 45 minutes on long runs
- **Thursday = total rest** — no active recovery
- Wednesday club runs are effort-based, not all-out

## Training Blocks
_All workouts tracked in separate block `.md` files._

| Block | Dates | Focus | File |
