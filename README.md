# Run Project

Minimal tracking of training and racing blocks for Paul and Jordan.

- `train/paul/` — Training blocks for Paul (maintenance and race prep)
- `train/jordan/` — Training blocks for Jordan (if/when confirmed)
- `race/paul/` — Race-day materials (strategy, pacing, warmups, fueling)
- `race/jordan/` — Race-day materials (only if Jordan commits to races)

Each folder is broken down by maintenance blocks or race-specific builds.
