# Run Project

Minimal tracking of training and racing blocks for Paul and Jordan.
All training supports a build toward the Royal Victoria Marathon on October 12, 2025.

- `train/paul/` — Training blocks for Paul (organized by goal or race)
- `train/jordan/` — Training blocks for Jordan
- `race/paul/` — Race-day materials (morning schedule, warmup, mantras, fueling)
- `race/jordan/` — Race-day materials

Each folder is flattened for simplicity: one `.md` file = one training block.
