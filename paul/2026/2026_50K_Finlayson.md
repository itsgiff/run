## Phase 1: Adaptation & Consistency (Jun 22 – Jul 19)

- Focus: Heat training, vert hikes, steep repeats
- Long runs: 3–4 hrs, gradually more tech terrain
- Vert target: 3000–4000m/month
- Evening runs to simulate race timing

## Phase 2: Peak Technical Load (Jul 20 – Aug 23)

- Long runs up to 6 hrs, 1600m+ vert
- Practice descending under fatigue
- Race-day gear and fueling tests
- Double summit weekends (e.g., Mt. Finlayson repeats)

## Phase 3: Taper & Specificity (Aug 24 – Sept 6)

- Reduce volume by 40–60%
- Focus on trail feel, fueling, and taper sharpness
- Final shakeout w/ race gear
- Race Day: **Sunday, September 6**

## Notes

- Race has steep ascents/descents — shoes must handle rock and dirt
- Practice fueling at effort, not just time
- Don’t chase time on long runs — focus on movement and control
- Confidence in poles, descending, and climbing efficiency = success
