- Run Bazan Bay 5K with confidence (PB attempt optional)
- Rebuild weekly volume consistently and safely
- Begin prepping legs for long aerobic efforts (Zone 2 endurance)
- Light trail/hill running for spring strength foundation

## Weekly Structure
- **Monday:** Easy run + bodyweight strength
- **Tuesday:** Aerobic or fartlek effort (Zone 2–3)

## Phase 1: Post-Cobble / Volume Rebuild (Jan 27 – Feb 18)
- Run 5 days/week (Mon/Tue/Wed/Fri/Sat), optional Sunday
- Tuesday fartleks (e.g. 6 × 2 min @ 10K effort)
- Saturday long runs rebuild to ~90 min by Feb 17
- FAC sessions at 80% — do not chase paces

## Phase 2: Bazan Bay 5K Sharpening (Feb 19 – Apr 13)
- Increase long run to 100–110 min
- Add structured Tuesday workouts (e.g. CV reps, 5K pace surges)
- Wednesday FAC sessions can include longer tempo (e.g. 15–20 min)
- Fridays include strides weekly (4–6 × 20s)
- **Race Week (Apr 6–13):** Light Tuesday sharpener + full taper
- **Apr 13:** **Bazan Bay 5K** — optional PB effort

---

## Sample Tuesday Workouts
- 6 × 2 min @ 5K effort / 90s jog
- 5 × 1K @ 10K pace w/ 75s jog
- 20-min tempo (Zone 3) w/ 4 strides after
- CV intervals: 4 × 4 min at controlled fast effort / 2 min jog

## Key Reminders
- Build volume before intensity — patience is key
- Monitor shin and foot health weekly
- Practice fueling on Saturday runs (carbs + hydration)
- Fridays = drills and strides. Always maintain form.
