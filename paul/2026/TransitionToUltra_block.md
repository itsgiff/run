- Mobility daily
- Saturday long run = 90 min max

### Week 2 (May 11–17)
**Focus:** Return to rhythm

- Gentle hills and forest trails
- Long run 1h45–2h

### Week 3 (May 18–24)

- Saturday = 2h trail run, Sunday = 60 min recovery trail
- Core and glute strength x2

### Week 4 (May 25–31)
**Focus:** Back-to-back long run intro

- Sun = 75 min easy trail or hike
- Add poles to hikes (if using for Broken Goat)
