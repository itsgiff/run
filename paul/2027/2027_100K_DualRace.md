## Notes

- Fat Dog is a remote, exposed race — hydration and salt management critical
- Fueling target: 250–300 cal/hr, tested with solids and gels
- Both races require waterproof jacket, emergency bivy, layering
- Poles and headlamp must be race-verified by July
- Watch battery + charge method tested by September
