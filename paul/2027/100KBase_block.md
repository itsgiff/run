# 2027 Q1 100K Base Block

**Dates:** January 1 – March 30, 2027  
**Duration:** 13 weeks  
**Purpose:** Build aerobic volume, vertical gain capacity, and base trail strength to support a successful Fat Dog 100K training progression

---

## Goals
- Weekly volume in time (not distance): 7–9 hrs base, progress to 10–12 hrs
- Build vertical: start with 500–1000m/week, progress to 1500–2000m/week
- Integrate hiking, poles, and long trail climbs
- Core, mobility, and lower leg durability emphasized weekly
- Stay healthy and consistent — no injuries, no race efforts

---

## Weekly Structure (Flexible)
- **Monday:** Easy trail recovery or rest + mobility/strength
- **Tuesday:** Trail intervals or vert builder (run/hike)
- **Wednesday:** Midweek aerobic (1.5 hr trail or hill run)
- **Thursday:** Rest or hike
- **Friday:** Easy run + drills/strides or pole technique
- **Saturday:** Long trail run (build to 4 hrs by Mar)
- **Sunday:** Short trail run or hike (Zone 1)

---

## Month-by-Month Focus

### **January (Weeks 1–4)**
- Total time: 6–8 hrs/week
- Long runs = 2–2.5 hrs on moderate trail
- Vert = 500–800m/week
- Strength 2x/week (core, hips, single-leg work)

### **February (Weeks 5–8)**
- Total time: 8–10 hrs/week
- Long runs = 3 hrs, introduce power hiking segments
- Weekly vert = 1000–1500m
- Add poles to 1–2 workouts/week
- Tuesday sessions: 4–5 × 5 min uphill reps or continuous climbing loops

### **March (Weeks 9–13)**
- Total time: 10–12 hrs/week
- Long runs = 3.5–4 hrs on trail
- Back-to-backs begin (e.g., Sat 3.5 hrs + Sun 90 min)
- Weekly vert = 1500–2000m
- Fueling strategy begins: gels every 45–60 min on long runs

---

## Key Reminders
- Avoid pace targets — focus on time, effort, and elevation
- Cross-train if injured or fatigued (bike, ski touring OK)
- Every 4th week = volume cutback (~60–70%)
- Use weather and trail conditions to adjust — no rigid structure
