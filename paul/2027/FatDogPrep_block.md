## Goals
- Build to 13–18 hrs/week of running/hiking volume
- Back-to-back long runs every weekend from Week 6 onward
- Vert peak: 3000–4000m/week by July

## Phase 1 – Base Extension (Apr 1 – May 12)
- Weekly time: 10–12 hrs
- Saturday long runs = 4 hrs by mid-May
- Sunday = 90–120 min hike or run
- Add heat adaptation strategies (layers, midday runs)

## Phase 2 – Peak Build (May 13 – Jul 7)
- Weekly time: 14–18 hrs
- Longest weekends: 6–7 hr Sat + 3–4 hr Sun
- Full gear simulation (poles, lights, vest)
- Night run simulation 1×/month
- Fueling locked in: every 45–60 min, full load practice

## Phase 3 – Peak / Taper Blend (Jul 8 – Aug 3)
- Final long run ~7 hrs (mid-July)
- Vert tapers from 3500m → 2000m
- No hard efforts — all Zone 1–2, hike when needed
- Final back-to-back 4+2 hrs, 2 weeks out

## Race Week (Aug 4 – Aug 10)
- Mon–Wed: Easy trail jogs only

## Reminders
- Recovery weeks every 4th week (drop volume 40%)

- Prioritize sleep and gut training in July
- Review elevation profile weekly — visualization helps
- Practice layering, headlamp, and nighttime trail cues
