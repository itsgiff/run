# 2027 Post-100K Recovery & Reset Block

**Dates:** September 21 – December 6, 2027  
**Duration:** 11 weeks  
**Purpose:** Deep recovery from dual 100Ks, rebuild durability, and begin laying the aerobic foundation for 2028 UTMB prep

---

## Goals
- Recover physically and mentally from a huge season
- Reintroduce movement gently — hiking, light trail jogs
- Maintain mobility, strength, and aerobic frequency without volume pressure
- No structured workouts or racing until December
- Begin thinking in “time-on-feet,” not speed or performance

---

## Weekly Structure (Flexible)
- **Monday:** Mobility or rest
- **Tuesday:** Easy jog or hike (30–60 min)
- **Wednesday:** Easy trail run or walk (~45 min)
- **Thursday:** Rest
- **Friday:** Jog or cross-train + light drills
- **Saturday:** Easy trail run/hike (max 90 min early on, progressing to 2 hrs)
- **Sunday:** Optional short aerobic (walk, jog, bike)

---

## Phases

### Phase 1 (Sep 21 – Oct 13): Full Recovery
- No back-to-backs
- Volume: ~50% of peak season
- Terrain: soft trails only, avoid long descents
- Strength: bodyweight + mobility 2×/week

### Phase 2 (Oct 14 – Nov 10): Easy Return
- Reintroduce 4–5 runs/week
- Weekend long run = 1.5–2 hrs (easy pace, no elevation targets)
- Hiking encouraged midweek for aerobic durability
- Begin light drills and short strides (20s × 4) 1×/week

### Phase 3 (Nov 11 – Dec 6): Rebuild Phase
- Volume = 60–70% of peak
- Long runs can extend to 2.5 hrs by early December
- Cross-train for variety (bike, snowshoe, hike)
- Strength work 2×/week (single-leg, core, glutes)

---

## Reminders
- You just finished two 100Ks — rest isn’t optional
- Mobility is your foundation for 2028
- Shin/knee/hip issues? Back off and cross-train
- Stay consistent, not heroic — this is about longevity
