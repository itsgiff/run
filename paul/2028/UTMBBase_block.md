# 2028 Q1 UTMB Base Block

**Dates:** January 1 – March 31, 2028  
**Duration:** 13 weeks  
**Goal Race:** UTMB 171K (August 2028)  
**Purpose:** Establish a strong aerobic, strength, and vert foundation for UTMB-specific training to begin in Q2

---

## Goals
- Build consistent volume to 12–15 hrs/week by March
- Elevation gain: ramp from 1500m/week → 3000m/week
- Establish regular back-to-backs on hilly terrain
- Reinforce lower body and core strength for long climbs/descents
- Maintain mobility, nutrition habits, and mental focus

---

## Weekly Structure (Time-based)
- **Monday:** Recovery jog or hike + mobility
- **Tuesday:** Vert-focused intervals or sustained climb/hike
- **Wednesday:** Aerobic trail (90–120 min, rolling terrain)
- **Thursday:** Rest or yoga/hike
- **Friday:** Trail run + drills/strides or short uphill surges
- **Saturday:** Long trail run (build to 5 hrs by late March)
- **Sunday:** Recovery trail run or hike (90–150 min)

---

## Monthly Progression

### January
- Weekly time: 8–10 hrs
- Long run: 3 hrs max
- Vert: 1500–2000m/week
- Strength: 2–3×/week (core, glutes, single-leg)
- Fueling: start using gels/hydration on weekends

### February
- Weekly time: 10–13 hrs
- Long run: 3.5–4 hrs
- Back-to-backs: every other weekend
- Vert: 2000–2500m/week
- Begin night run simulations (30–45 min)

### March
- Weekly time: 12–15 hrs
- Long run: up to 5 hrs
- Back-to-backs every weekend
- Vert: 2500–3000m/week
- Practice full kit: vest, poles, lights, jacket

---

## Key Reminders
- All effort Zone 1–2 unless otherwise noted
- Run by time, not distance — time on feet is the metric
- Include 1 full down week every 4 weeks (volume 60–70%)
- Adapt schedule based on weather/trail access — treadmill incline OK
