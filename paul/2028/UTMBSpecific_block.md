# 2028 UTMB-Specific Block

**Dates:** April 1 – August 25, 2028  
**Duration:** 21 weeks  
**Goal Race:** UTMB 171K (Aug 25–27, 2028, est.)  
**Purpose:** Peak preparation for UTMB including multi-day simulation, extreme vert accumulation, gear/fueling mastery, and mental rehearsal

---

## Goals
- Weekly time-on-feet: 15–22 hrs by July
- Elevation gain: build from 3000m/week to 5000m+/week
- Complete at least two 8–10 hr runs and one 12+ hr simulation
- Integrate sleep deprivation and night running experience
- Master poles, fueling, kit layering, and trail problem-solving

---

## Weekly Structure (Time-Dominant)
- **Monday:** Recovery jog or rest + mobility
- **Tuesday:** Long sustained climb (90–120 min) + pole work
- **Wednesday:** Midweek trail run (2–3 hrs, rolling terrain)
- **Thursday:** Active recovery hike or full rest
- **Friday:** Easy aerobic run or shakeout
- **Saturday:** Long run (build to 8–10 hrs)
- **Sunday:** Back-to-back support run or hike (2–4 hrs)

## Block Phases

### Phase 1 – Simulation Builder (Apr 1 – May 12)
- Long run: 4–6 hrs
- Weekly time: 12–16 hrs
- Vert: 3000–3500m/week
- Begin structured pole use, fueling logs, and gear review

### Phase 2 – Volume + Fatigue Resistance (May 13 – Jul 14)
- Long run: 6–10 hrs
- Back-to-back weekends every week
- Vert: 4000–5000m/week minimum
- Run/hike >80% of trail time
- 1 overnight run/month (start at 9pm, run 4–5 hrs)
- Final 12 hr simulation in early July

### Phase 3 – Peak & Taper (Jul 15 – Aug 25)
- Long runs taper from 8 hrs → 5 hrs → 3 hrs
- Final back-to-back weekend: Aug 3–4 (6 hrs + 3 hrs)
- Reduce vert from 5000m → 2500m by taper week
- Final gear/hydration/fueling dress rehearsal: Aug 10–11

---

## Race Week (Aug 19–25)
- Mon–Wed: Shakeouts (30–45 min) + gear checks
- Thu: Full rest
- Fri: Travel/prep
- Sat–Sun: **Race – UTMB 171K**
- Mon: Full rest or gentle walk

---

## Execution Mantras
- "Hike early, finish late"
- "Fuel before you're hungry, hydrate before you're dry"
- "Mountains are patient — so must you be"
- "Forward is forward, even at 20 min/km"

---

## Final Notes
- Weekly log updates mandatory (fuel, gear, mood)
- Prioritize feet, gut, and head — not fitness
- Practice all mandatory kit until second-nature
- Use past race visuals to mentally rehearse all climbs
