# 2028 Post-UTMB Recovery & Reset Block

**Dates:** August 26 – November 30, 2028  
**Duration:** 14 weeks  
**Purpose:** Deep recovery after UTMB 171K, full physical reset, and space for mental recalibration and life balance

---

## Goals
- Prioritize full-body healing after the longest effort of your life
- Rebuild slowly, beginning with movement, not training
- Resume aerobic consistency by mid-to-late fall, not before
- Let go of training targets — focus on gratitude, reflection, and balance

---

## Phase 1 – Full Reset (Aug 26 – Sep 22)
- No structured runs
- Walks, hikes, and sleep prioritized
- Massage, mobility, light strength as desired
- Log subjective recovery weekly (energy, mood, motivation)
- Avoid planning the next big goal too early — let it come naturally

## Phase 2 – Gentle Return (Sep 23 – Oct 31)
- 3–4 days/week of aerobic movement (30–60 min)
- Trail jogs welcome, no pace pressure
- Saturday = adventure day (hike or slow trail run)
- Strength work 1–2×/week (bodyweight preferred)
- Short strides (20s) can be reintroduced in mid-October

## Phase 3 – Rebuild Foundation (Nov 1 – Nov 30)
- Weekly volume: 5–7 hrs
- Long run max = 90 min
- Reestablish mobility routine
- Identify 2029 goals (if desired) and reflect on UTMB takeaways

---

## Weekly Template (Flexible)
- **Monday:** Rest or light mobility
- **Tuesday:** Easy aerobic + light drills
- **Wednesday:** Walk or hike
- **Thursday:** Rest
- **Friday:** Easy jog or spin
- **Saturday:** Trail adventure or exploratory route
- **Sunday:** Hike or full rest

---

## Key Practices
- Journal weekly: what’s changed since UTMB?
- Cross-train as desired (bike, swim, paddle)
- If motivation dips — that’s normal. Welcome it.
- Give your nervous system space. The trail will wait.

**Next Block:** TBD based on your 2029 goals — you’ve earned this season of peace.
