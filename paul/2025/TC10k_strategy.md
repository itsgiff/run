## Execution Plan

- **First 3K:**
  - Smooth, patient start — **no faster than 4:52/km**.
  - Find breathing rhythm, don't get pulled by early race energy.
  - **Mantras:** "Patience wins races." "Calm is fast."

- **Middle 4K (KM 4–7):**
  - Lock into steady work at goal pace (4:48/km).
  - Focus on cadence and quick, efficient stride.
  - **Mantras:** "Hold rhythm. Strong and smooth."

- **Final 3K (KM 8–10):**
  - Build pressure gradually from 8K onward.
  - Drive with arms, stay tall, stay aggressive without forcing.
  - Finish last KM at full effort — 4:35–4:40/km if able.
  - **Mantras:** "Now is the time." "Finish proud."

## Fueling and Hydration Plan

- **Breakfast:** Light, familiar food about 2.5–3 hours before race.
- **Optional:** Small gel or 1/2 banana ~15 minutes before start.
- **During Race:** Sip water at 5K aid station only if needed (very small sip).

---

## Mental Cues

- "Smooth early, strong late."
- "Quick feet, steady breathing."
- "Finish faster than you started."

---

**Final Reminder:** Don't race the first 3K. Be patient early, decisive late.
