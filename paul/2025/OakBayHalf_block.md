# Key Notes

* **Long Runs** are critical — treat Saturdays as the most important day each week.
* **Wednesday sessions** (Frontrunners) — effort only, not pace-driven. Final big session on May 7.
* **Taper Strategy** — reduce TSS by 30–40% in week of May 6–12, then 20% more in week of May 13–19.
* **Shin Splint Management** — if any warning signs increase, modify volume immediately.
* **Fueling Practice** — take gels every 45–50 minutes during long runs.
* **Final Week Focus** — fresh legs, short runs, easy strides, and race readiness.
