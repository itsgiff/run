## Execution Plan

- **First 2K:**
  - Settle into rhythm, easy breathing.
  - *Effort should feel easier than expected.*
  - **Key mantra:** "Hold back. Stay smooth."

- **Middle 3K (KM 3–5):**
  - Steady working effort.
  - Shorten stride slightly on climbs, open on descents.
  - Stay strong and tall.
  - **Key mantra:** "Strength through rhythm."

- **Final 2K (KM 6–8):**
  - Take advantage of downhill — increase turnover.
  - Build to full effort over final KM.
  - No early sprint — commit at 500m to go.
  - **Key mantra:** "Fast feet, big heart."

## Fueling and Hydration Plan

- **Breakfast:** Light, familiar foods (toast, banana, small coffee) ~3 hours pre-race.
- **Pre-race:** Optional: sip water or light electrolyte.
- **During Race:** No fueling required for 8K. Sip water before start if dry conditions.

---

## Mental Cues

- "Start smart, finish fierce."
- "Relax early, fight late."
- "Push effort only once you smell the barn (last 2K)."

---

**Final Reminder:**  
The first 2K must feel almost "too easy." You are banking energy for the hills and the late move.  
Strong finish wins the race, not a hot start.
