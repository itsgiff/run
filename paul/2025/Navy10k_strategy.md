## Execution Plan

- **First 500m (uphill start):**
  - Take it extremely easy — even a fast walk is acceptable if needed.
  - Focus on posture: shoulders relaxed, arms driving gently.
  - Save your legs for the main part of the race.
  - **Mantra:** "Climb calm."

- **KM 0.5–3:**
  - Settle into a comfortable, relaxed effort.
  - Smooth breathing, smooth strides.
  - **Mantra:** "Run relaxed. Run proud."

- **Middle 4K (KM 4–7):**
  - Hold a steady, sustainable effort.
  - Stay mentally steady — work in small segments.
  - **Mantra:** "Every step stronger."

- **Final 1.5K (KM 8–9.5):**
  - Gradually build your effort.
  - Stay upright, don't lean too far forward.
  - **Mantra:** "Every step stronger."

- **Last 500m (downhill to finish):**
  - Let gravity help — open your stride but stay controlled.
  - Focus on turnover (quick feet) rather than braking.
  - Finish strong and proud.

## Fueling and Hydration Plan

- **Breakfast:** Light and familiar foods about 2 hours before race.
- **Mid-Race:** Sip of water if needed at aid station (especially if warm).

---

## Mental Cues

- "Run relaxed. Run proud."
- "Every step stronger."
- "Climb calm. Finish smooth."

---

**Final Reminder:** Stay patient on the hill at the start. Settle in. Finish strong down the hill.
