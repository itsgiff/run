## Execution Plan

- **KM 0–10:**  
  Stay relaxed, light on feet, and avoid any surges. Settle into rhythm by KM 5.  
  **Mantra:** "Relax, you’re just warming up."

- **KM 10–30:**  
  Lock into marathon effort. Focus on cadence and mental calm. Fuel early.  
  **Mantra:** "This is your pace. Settle in."

- **KM 30–37:**  
  Begin applying pressure if legs feel stable. Keep posture strong.  
  **Mantra:** "You trained for this. Hold your line."

- **KM 37–42.2:**  
  Push. Commit fully. One aid station at a time.  
  **Mantra:** "Strong mind. Brave heart. Finish proud."

## Fueling and Hydration Plan

- **Breakfast:** 3 hours before race start.
- **Gels:**
  - Gel 1: 45 minutes (around KM 8–9)
  - Gel 2: 90 minutes (around KM 18–19)
  - Gel 3: 135 minutes (around KM 28–29)
  - Gel 4 (optional): KM 36 if digestion allows
- **Hydration:** Small sips at every aid station. Do not skip.

## Mental Cues

- "Relax, you’re just warming up."
- "This is your pace. Settle in."
- "You trained for this. Hold your line."
- "Strong mind. Brave heart. Finish proud."

**Final Reminder:**  
Don’t chase the first 10K. You’re running the second half. Be steady. Be calm. Be tough when it counts.
