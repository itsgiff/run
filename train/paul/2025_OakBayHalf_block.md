# Key Notes

- **Long Runs** are critical — treat Saturdays as the most important day each week.
- **Wednesday sessions** (Frontrunners) — run them based on feel, do not chase paces.
- **Shin Splint Management** — if any warning signs increase, modify volume immediately.
- **Fueling Practice** — take gels every 45–50 minutes during long runs.
- **Taper Week** — prioritize rest, easy short runs, and keep the legs fresh.
