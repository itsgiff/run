# Key Notes

- Monday easy runs are essential for aerobic recovery.
- Tuesday workouts sharpen speed gradually toward 10K peak effort.
- Wednesday Run Club sessions should be done on feel — not max effort.
- Thursday rest days are non-negotiable — prioritize full recovery.
- Saturday long runs help retain aerobic endurance but finish strong when healthy.
- Friday before race: full rest to arrive fresh for Navy 10K.
